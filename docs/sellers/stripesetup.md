# Setting up your Stripe account

Stripe is the online payment processor used by the Art & Object Marketplace. It is used for both the buyer purchasing process as well as paying out account balances to our sellers. As a seller, you will need to create an account with Stripe and connect your bank to your account. There is no cost to you for the account or for the payouts to your bank. All of your information will be secured and managed by Stripe.

To get started, you will need to go to [your profile page](https://www.artandobject.shop/seller/settings) and click on the setup link. This will take you to a Stripe page with our branding asking for your Stripe account email address. If you already have an account with Stripe, this is an easy process of providing that email address for the existing account and then verifying your password (and possibly two form authentication).

If you're new to Stripe, provide an email address that you manage. Later on, you'll be able to add other team members to your account, so no need to worry about whose email address to use for now. However, the person filling out this form must be someone with significant control and management of your business. Also, going through the process of creating a new Stripe account, you will need to know/gather the following information:

 * Mobile number. This is used for two form authenication sent by SMS, so provide a mobile number of a phone you have access to.
 * Business location. What country?
 * Type of Business: Individual, Company, or Nonprofit.
 * Business Structure: Sole proprietorship, Single member LLC, etc.
 * Legal Business Name
 * Employer Identification Number (EIN)
 * Doing Business As (DBA)
 * Registered Business Address
 * Type of Industry
 * Business Website
 * Product Description
 * Business Representative: Contact information for the person filling out this form. At some point, Stripe will request an image of the Business Representative's identification document (i.e. drivers license).
 * Banking information: Routing and account number
 * Public Details for Customers: The statement and shortened descriptor aren't used in the Art & Object Marketplace, but if you were to use Stripe for other purposes, that may be used.

Once you're done, you can click the button at the bottom of the form to submit the application and be returned to the Art & Object Marketplace. Once you're back on our site, if you continue to see the setup link, click it to return back to Stripe to complete any missing information/steps.

If the warning box is not visible on your profile settings page and you see something like this:

At any point, you can come to the profile settings page to click on the link to your Stripe account and make any financial account changes.
