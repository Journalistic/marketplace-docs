<p>November 1, 2023</p>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This User Agreement for desktop and mobile accessible formats of the Art &amp; Object Marketplace, and all policies and additional terms posted on and in our sites, tools, and services (collectively "Services") set out the terms on which Art &amp; Object Marketplace offers you access to and use of our Services. You agree to comply with all terms of this User Agreement when accessing or using our Services.  This User Agreement addresses terms and conditions for both Buyers and Sellers of the Marketplace.  Additional terms and conditions may apply to Sellers.

The physical address of the business is 100 Europa Drive, STE 290, Chapel Hill, NC 27517, United States of America.

This User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims that you and we may have with each other are resolved (Section 18). It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us or our agents to binding and final arbitration.  Please read these sections carefully.</p>
<h2 id="2-about-art-object-marketplace">2. About Art &amp; Object Marketplace</h2>
<p>Art &amp; Object Marketplace is an online marketplace that allows Sellers and Buyers to sell and purchase of works of art.  To be a Buyer or a Seller, the user must establish an account and agree to these Terms of Service that includes this User Agreement.
Any information the Art &amp; Object Marketplace provides as part of our Services, such as pricing, shipping, listing, and sourcing is solely informational, and you may decide to act upon it or not. We may help facilitate the resolution of disputes between Buyers and Sellers through various efforts. Unless otherwise expressly provided, Art &amp; Object Marketplace has no control over and does not warranty: the availability, quality, safety, or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of Seller’s content or listings; the ability of Sellers to sell items; the ability of Buyers to pay for items; or that a Buyer or Seller will actually complete any particular transaction.</p>
<h2 id="3-using-art-object-marketplace">3. Using Art &amp; Object Marketplace</h2>
<p>Art &amp; Object Marketplace uses Stripe as a payment processor, and Sellers must have a Stripe account in place to sell with us. This is necessary for Buyers to make purchases from Sellers, and for Art &amp; Object Marketplace to collect and pay-out proceeds to Sellers.
When using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not:
breach or circumvent any laws, regulations, third-party rights or our systems, Services, policies, or determinations of your account status;
use our Services if you are not able to form legally binding contracts (for example, if you are under 18 years old), or are temporarily or indefinitely suspended from using our Services, or are a person with whom transactions are prohibited under economic or trade sanctions;
fail to pay for items purchased by you, unless you have a valid reason as set out in Art &amp; Object Marketplace policies, for example, our Refund Policy;

infringe upon the copyright, trademark, patent, publicity, moral, database, and/or other intellectual property rights (collectively, "Intellectual Property Rights") that belong to or are licensed to Art &amp; Object Marketplace. Some, but not all, actions that may constitute infringement are reproducing, performing, displaying, distributing, copying, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or preparing derivative works from content that belongs to Art &amp; Object Marketplace or someone else;
Infringe upon any Intellectual Property Rights that belong to third parties affected by your use of our Services or post content that does not belong to you except as provided by the Service. An example of content you may use are Artist biographical sketches as associated with works of art;
commercialize any Art &amp; Object Marketplace application or any information, data, or software associated with such application, except with the prior express permission of Art &amp; Object Marketplace; or
harvest or otherwise collect or use information about users without their consent.
The ability to list items for sale on the Art &amp; Object Marketplace is by invitation only and requires the continued meeting of professional standards as outlined in this agreement.  Failure to meet these standards may, with reasonable notice, result in Art &amp; Object Marketplace limiting, restricting, suspending, or downgrading a Seller’s account.
Selling art displayed on the site outside of the Marketplace services after contact between a Buyer and Seller has been established on the Marketplace is not allowed.  If you circumvent our services, we may suspend your use of them. 
Accounts that are unauthorized by us or become dormant may be removed.  Additionally, the Marketplace reserves the right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone for any reason. When packing art for shipment, sellers should follow the Arta guidelines for packing art, which can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Journalistic/marketplace-docs/files/13562641/Artas.Packing.Guide.pdf">Artas Packing Guide.pdf</a>.</p>
<h2 id="4-policy-enforcement">4. Policy Enforcement</h2>
<p>In an effort to ensure both the Buyer and Seller have a positive experience, when a Buyer or Seller issue arises, we may consider additional factors including past actions and performance of the parties in applying our policies. Even so, we maintain our right to resolve matters in the following ways:  to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone, or to terminate this agreement with anyone, for any reason at our discretion.</p>
<h2 id="5-fees-and-taxes">5. Fees and Taxes</h2>
<p>Sellers are charged for the use of our Services.  Fees are posted on the Seller Dashboard. We may change our selling fees from time to time and will post the changes on the Art &amp; Object Marketplace site thirty (30) days in advance.
Buyers are not charged for the use of our Services except in the purchases and deliveries made by them.  In some instances, Buyers will incur fees to third parties in connection to a transaction, for example, bank or credit card fees in conjunction with the transaction, state and local taxes, or shipping services.  Any fee that Art &amp; Object Marketplace charges to a Buyer will be shown on the final invoice at checkout, and the Buyer will have the opportunity to review those fees and proceed or decline the transaction, at their discretion.
If you are a Seller, you are liable for fees arising out of all sales made using some or all of our Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of Art &amp; Object Marketplace. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a Buyer for their contact information with the intention of buying or selling outside of Art &amp; Object Marketplace, you may be liable to pay any fees applicable to that item.
Sellers must have current banking information on file when using our selling Services so that we can pay-out Buyer purchase proceeds while also withholding Marketplace commissions, fees, and applicable taxes associated with your use of our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may place restrictions on your account, or the Art &amp; Object Marketplace. Collections of amounts due from Sellers will be made through any method you have provided the Art &amp; Object Marketplace at any time, or any additional lawful method.<br />
Art &amp; Object Marketplace collects all applicable taxes during any transaction.  This collection is handled by a third party, Tax Jar, and these monies are remitted directly to the agencies responsible for charging them.  Sales tax is one such tax that is often collected, although sales tax laws vary state-to-state, and are charged according to those rules and regulations.
Art &amp; Object Marketplace is intended by Buyers and Sellers in the United States.  Buyers located outside of the United States or its territories are welcome to make purchases, but purchases must be received at a location inside the U.S. or its territories. All transactions must be conducted in U.S. Dollars and through a U.S.-based bank.  To sell on the Art &amp; Object Marketplace, Sellers must have a physical U.S. location and shipping of works must originate from the U.S. or its territories.  Buyers outside the United States or its territories wishing to make purchases and receive goods outside of the U.S. or its territories will be directed to the Seller, who may conclude this transaction outside of the Marketplace at their discretion.  Art &amp; Object Marketplace collects no fees on such transactions and provides no service and is indemnified by the Buyer and the Seller of any responsibility or wrongdoing in the course of that transaction.</p>
<h2 id="6-listing-conditions-for-sellers">6. Listing Conditions for Sellers</h2>
<p>When listing an item for sale on our Services, Seller agrees to comply with Art &amp; Object Marketplace's listing and selling policies and also agree that:
You are fully responsible for the item offered and the accuracy and content of the listing, including images and the rights to those.
Your listing will remain on the site until sold or removed by you.  Items sold outside of the service to Buyers that were using the service for review of that particular item may incur selling fees.<br />
Any listing that violates any of Art &amp; Object Marketplace's policies will be removed at Art &amp; Object Marketplace's sole discretion.
We reserve the right to modify, add, or remove data to ensure a listing can be found by Buyers.
A listing may not appear in some search and browse results regardless of the search terms and sort order chosen by the Buyer.  Certain types of art may take precedence in listing results over others.
Original works of art may take precedence over multiples or reproductions.
Metatags, URL links, and irrelevant keywords are not allowed. 
Art &amp; Object Marketplace may publish and promote your listings, including related content such as images, username, reviews and feedback on the Marketplace.
Listings do not have exclusive rights on our Services.  For example, works in multiples may co-exist with another numbered copy.
Items that may be delayed in shipping must be so stated in the Description of the item.  For example, if an item is part of a show and will not ship if purchased until the conclusion of the show, it must be so stated to the prospective Buyer.</p>
<h2 id="7-purchase-conditions-for-buyers">7. Purchase Conditions for Buyers</h2>
<p>When buying an item using our Services, you agree to the rules and policies for Buyers and that:
You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making an offer, buying, or committing to buy,
You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you buy the item, commit to buy the item, your offer for the item is accepted, regardless of when payment is due or received,
